#  Introduction

This CircuitPython library is compatible with character LCDs using the HD44780
parallel interface chipset with an I2C adapter board based on PCF8574 I2C chip.
For example:

* [MakerLab 16x2 LCD Display MLE00659](https://www.makerlab-electronics.com/products/16x2-lcd-display-i2c-black-on-green)
* [MakerLab 20x4 LCD Display MLE00661](https://www.makerlab-electronics.com/products/20x4-lcd-display-i2c-black-on-green)

It is derived from the `adafruit_character_lcd.character_lcd.Character_LCD`
class.
